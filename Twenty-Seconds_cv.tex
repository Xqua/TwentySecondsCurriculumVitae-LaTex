\aboutme{
With a Ph.D. in Computational Biology from Harvard University and a Master from the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) ULM I research different computational methods around developmental biology. I Co-Founded the Non Profit organization Just One Giant Lab to promote Open Science across the world and try to make the planet a little bit better and fairer. JOGL is the first research and innovation laboratory accessible to anybody, operating as a distributed, open and massive mobilisation platform for volunteer-based, IP-free task solving. With an expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning I focused my studies on sequence data and image analysis. I am an advocate of interdisciplinary projects and believe in collective inteligence as the key to solving complex problems. I have been involved with the european union parliament on science policy surrounding green energy transition. Finally, I am an Open Science and Open Source advocate through participation in multiple projects. Child of the cypherpunk hacker subculture.
